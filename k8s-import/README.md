# K8s Import

This directory contains all the Concord flows, custom Helm charts, and K8s manifests required to build a fully functional K8s cluster. Eventually this content will be separated, but currently YAML content will be interpreted by Concord as its flows which causes an issue. Hopefully some logic can be added that can delineate Concord flow YAML from other YAML.
